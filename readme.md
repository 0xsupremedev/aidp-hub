## 🚀 The Vision

MicroAPI Hub is the production-ready gateway to the **AIDP Ecosystem**. It transforms decentralized compute from a speculative asset into a reliable utility for developers. By abstracting the complexity of P2P routing and cryptographic verification, we provide a "calm infrastructure" experience that competes with centralized cloud providers on performance, cost, and reliability.

## 🏛 5-Layer DePIN Architecture

The codebase follows the systematic **AIDP 5-Layer Design** for modular infrastructure:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Application Layer"
        A[MicroAPI Hub Portal]
    end
    subgraph "Logic & Verification"
        B[AIDP SDK] --> C[Verification Engine]
        C --> D[PoR / PoD Proofs]
    end
    subgraph "P2P & Routing"
        E[Orchestrator]
    end
    subgraph "Physical Layer"
        F[GPU Provider Nodes]
    end
    A --> B
    B --> E
    E --> F
```

- **`aidp-marketplace`**: The primary interaction layer for developers.
- **`aidp-sdk`**: Cryptographic libraries for PoR/PoD proof generation.
- **`aidp-orchestrator`**: Intelligent routing for decentralized inference.
- **`aidp-verification`**: The settlement engine for trustless work.
- **`aidp-node`**: Software for the physical GPU providers.
